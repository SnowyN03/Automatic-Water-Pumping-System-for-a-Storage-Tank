Project Overview
The automatic water pumping system will monitor the water level in the storage tank and automatically turn on the pump when the water level drops below a specified threshold. Once the tank is full, the pump will turn off to avoid overflow. This system helps prevent water wastage and ensures a steady supply of water.

Components Needed:
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno or ESP8266
Relay Module: To control the water pump
Water Pump: Submersible or any suitable pump
Water Level Sensor (Float Switch or Ultrasonic Sensor): To detect the water level
Power Supply: 5V or 12V depending on the pump and microcontroller
Connecting Wires: For connections
Breadboard: For prototyping (optional)
Diode and Transistor (optional): To protect the circuit from back EMF from the relay.


Working Principle:
The water level sensor placed in the storage tank detects the current water level.
If the water level is below the minimum threshold, the microcontroller activates the relay module to turn on the water pump.
The pump continues to operate until the water level sensor detects that the water has reached the maximum threshold.
Once the water reaches the maximum level, the microcontroller sends a signal to the relay to turn off the pump.
The system repeats this process automatically to maintain a desired water level in the storage tank.


Wiring:
Water Level Sensor: Connect to the analog or digital input pins of the microcontroller (depending on the type of sensor).
Relay Module:
VCC to 5V of the microcontroller.
GND to GND of the microcontroller.
Control pin to a digital output pin (e.g., D7 on ESP8266).


Water Pump:
Connect the pump to the power supply through the relay.
Ensure that the relay can handle the voltage and current rating of the pump.


Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE (or ESP8266 IDE if using ESP8266).
Install libraries if using sensors like ultrasonic (e.g., NewPing library for ultrasonic sensors).

Explanation:
Ultrasonic sensor (or float switch) measures the water level by detecting the distance from the sensor to the surface of the water.
When the water level drops below the MIN_DISTANCE, the relay is activated, turning on the pump.
When the water reaches the MAX_DISTANCE, the pump is turned off by deactivating the relay.
The system checks the water level every 2 seconds using the delay(2000) function in the loop.


Optional Enhancements:
Add an LCD display to show real-time water levels.
Use Blynk or MQTT to send alerts to your phone when the water level is too low or the tank is full.
Integrate a flow sensor to monitor the flow rate and ensure the pump is operating correctly.
Add safety features like a manual override button or an emergency shut-off if the system detects a malfunction.
